# WEB102 Prework - Sea Monster Crowdfunding

Submitted by: Penelope Lai

Sea Monster Crowdfunding is a website for the company Sea Monster Crowdfunding that displays information about the games they have funded.

Time spent: 5 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- ✅ The introduction section explains the background of the company and how many games remain unfunded.
- ✅ The Stats section includes information about the total contributions and dollars raised as well as the top two most funded games.
- ✅ The Our Games section initially displays all games funded by Sea Monster Crowdfunding
- ✅ The Our Games section has three buttons that allow the user to display only unfunded games, only funded games, or all games.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- ✅ I updated the title of the website, make it centered on the top using 'justify-content: center'.
- ✅ I added a selected state (CSS) for the three buttons filtering different types of games.

## Notes

One of the challenges I faced was working with DOM-related methods, but the provided resources were very helpful in refreshing my knowledge.
